  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey there! Let me tell you a bit about myself. My name is Enrique, I'm a 22-year-old guy from Mexico. Even though I consider myself pretty shy, perhaps more than I like to admit, I really care about my loved ones and genuinely mean no harm to anyone. Oh, I can't forget to mention my lovely 1-year-old havanese dog, her name is Key.
  </p>
  
  <p>I'm a mechatronics engineering student, althought I'm currently taking a break due to personal reasons, I'm still curious and passionate about mechanics, control theory, robotics and electronics, which are the foundations of mechatronics. Meanwhile I'm teaching myself web development (yep, this website is one of my personal projects derived from that); who knows, maybe this will prove useful to earn some money and help my familly out while paying for my education. I know I've got a long way to go before I can finish my degree, but I'm staying optimistic.
  </p>
  
  <p>Now, let's talk about my hobbies. Music holds a special place in my heart. I play the piano, but I certainly wouldn't consider myself skilled at it, I just enjoy the experience, it's a whole lot of fun. The world of music is incredibly vast and captivating that I can only aspire to discover as many artists, genres and music venues as I can. Lately I've been hooked on jazz and electronic music, which I enjoy listening to in my spare time. Aditionaly I can't forget about videogames. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but it's always fun when I can play alongside with my friends.
